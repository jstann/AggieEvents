# AggieEvents

**Problem Statement:** Students at North Carolina A&T have a hard time keeping up with campus events because there are many scattered and irregular channels for communication, which include emails, social media, and postings by individual organizations. Some organizations are not featured on 1891Connect, so if someone does not have Instagram, they are completely in the dark regarding organizations that interest them. As a result, opportunities for engagement are missed, extracurricular activities become underparticipated, and a sense of community needs to be stronger. Existing solutions need to provide an integrated, user-friendly platform that suits the preferences and schedules of students.

**Proposed Solution:**
A web application named AggieEvents was built using Python and Streamlit, providing a centralized platform for students to browse, filter, and RSVP to campus events.

**Who will use it?**
- Current students at North Carolina A&T.
- Event organizers who want to share information more effectively.

**Key Features:**
- Centralized Event Feed: Displays events from multiple sources in a clean, searchable interface.
- Filtering and Personalization: Students can filter events by category (e.g., academic, social, athletic).
- RSVP System: Tracks attendance for events and sends confirmation emails.
- Reminders and Notifications: Includes countdowns or email notifications for registered events.
- Feedback Option: A form for users to rate events and suggest improvements.

**Technologies to Use:**
- Frontend: Streamlit for UI development.
- Backend: Python Flask/Django for API (optional for more advanced functionality).
- Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing event and user data.
- APIs: Integrate with platforms like Google Calendar or existing campus systems if accessible.
- Email Notifications: Use Python libraries like smtplib or services like SendGrid for sending reminders.
